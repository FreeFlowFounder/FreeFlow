# FreeFlow

**Censorship-Resistant Crowdfunding for the Freedom Economy**

FreeFlow is a crypto-native fundraising platform designed for causes often excluded by legacy payment systems. Built for ideological, faith-based, and freedom-aligned fundraising, FreeFlow enables global donations across chains, optional anonymity, and trustless validator curation — without relying on banks or middlemen.
